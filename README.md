# AutoML Loss Landscape Analyzers

Provides a collection of methods for analyzing the loss landcapes of AutoML
problem scenarios. These methods were used to analyze the landscapes studied
in Pushak & Hoos [2022a]. We showed using these methods that the
hyper-parameters of classic machine learning algorithms tend to result in
relatively benign hyper-parameter responses. In particular, these landscapes
appear to be statisticaly indistinguishable from uni-modal (or very close to it)
and they have relativey simple hyper-parameter interactions. That is, optimzing
each hyper-parameter independently a single time, and in a random order, often
yields final incumbents that are statistically tied with optimal.

This work builds on a line of research 
(see https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/algorithms/Projects/ACLandscapes/index.html) 
that seeks to analyze and exploit algorithm configuration landscape structure.

# Usage

The script `benchmark_analyzer.py` defines the `Benchmark` base class,
which contains most of the logic for how to analyze an AutoML loss landscape.
There exists a separate class for each AutoML scenario that inherits from
this base class, and provides alternative implementations of the landscape
analysis methods, where appropriate. Usage of each of these analysis methods
is described in the docstrings of each method. 

For example,

    from svm_analyzer import SVMBenchmark
    analyzer = SVMBenchmark()
    is_unimodal = analyzer.test_reject_unimodality()

will run run the test for uni-modality on the SVM scenario and print some
information to the console about its progress. If successful, it should
take about 10-30 seconds to run and should print:

    100% done making the configuration table
    Iteration: 1; Heap size: 0; Still Unreached: 1399; Neighbours: 05; Quality: 0.23517
    Iteration: 1000; Heap size: 136; Still Unreached: 264; Neighbours: 06; Quality: 0.32207
    Iteration: 1400; Heap size: 0; Still Unreached: 0; Neighbours: 04; Quality: 0.49307
    100.00% of the state space was visited during the search procedure.
    0 of the configurations were determined to remain unreachable.
    Therefore, we cannot reject the possibility that this benchmark has 1 mode or less with 95.0% confidence.

# Data

The data for the smaller AutoML Loss Landscapes is stored directly in this
github directory. For the FCNet and Xgboost scenarios, the data needs to
be separately downloaded, and then you can tell their corresponding
analyzers where to find the raw data files for analysis.

These can be downloaded from:
